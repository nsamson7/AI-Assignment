AI used: Github (CoPilot)

Reflection:
  Before I fed the question prompts into the co-pilot AI, I went into a word doc and thought of the questions I was going to feed into it, trying to be as detail as I can. To my surprise
  it was very accurate with minor tweaks I had help guide the AI such as assigning it to the same variable name as shown in the credit card fraud EDA example. Some of the benefits that I
  found with using the AI co-pilot was how fast it was making the code and based on what you wanted and the files it had access to, it was able to output plots and different parts of the 
  EDA with no problem. Another advantage that I found with using the co-pilot was how deadly accurate it was in creating the code, but that only goes so far depending on how detailed the 
  prompt is that you give it. It was pretty easy duplicating the code of the example analysis by using the co-pilot in VS code.

  Some of the dangers of using co-pilot is it's not very beginner friendly in terms of learning because the co-pilot is doing all the work for you. The only thinking that I did really was
  thinking of the questions that I wanted to insert into the AI and making sure that I got every detail in order to get the exact same plots as the example analysis. Other than that, I 
  didn't use my head or learn much when using the AI. I pretty much was verifying if the code output was correct by comparing it to the example analysis rather than checking at the end.
  Between each plot, I had to make minor tweaks, so I was checking while inputting the pre-made prompts that I created. Using AI co-pilot is a double edged sword where it is accurate and
  efficient but also not a good learning tool for learning how to code.
